# Alertist

A simple alert management system built on top of the native "<dialog>" HTML tag.

Simply install the package:

```
npm install alertjs
```

and then import it in your project.

```javascript
import alertist from 'alertist';
```

Don't forget to import either the SASS file for styling inside the
`src/css/main.scss` or include the `dist/alertist.css` file in your
document.

That's it! You can refer to #TODO# for some documentation on how to use it.
