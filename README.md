# AlertJS

A simple alert management system built on top of the native "<dialog>" HTML tag.

Simply install the package:

```
npm install alertjs
```

and then import it in your project.

```javascript
import alertjs from 'alertjs';
```

That's it! You can refer to #TODO# for some documentation on how to use it.
